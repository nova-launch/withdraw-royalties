# Royalty Withdraw Tool

This is a simple tool that allows anyone to run instructions to withdraw royalties from any NFT project launched by Nova Launch.

To use this tool, you need to input the project's master account and press the button to withdraw royalties.

Note that while royalties can be withdrawn by anyone (the instruction is permissionless), they are always only sent to the appropriate wallets for the project in question.
